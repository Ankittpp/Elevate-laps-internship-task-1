# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing – Task 1

## What I Did
- Removed duplicate records from the dataset  
- Handled missing values using filtering and imputation  
- Standardized categorical values (e.g., gender, country names)  
- Converted date fields into a consistent format (`dd-mm-yyyy`)  
- Renamed column headers for clarity and consistency  
- Corrected data types (e.g., age → integer, dates → datetime)  

The result is a clean and structured dataset ready for analysis.
